# restart_bluetooth
**Restarts the Bluetooth service in OS X.**

Because sometimes switching it OFF and ON is too much like work.

## Requirements
1. Install [blueutil](https://github.com/toy/blueutil): `$ brew install blueutil`
2. If you want a Mac GUI app because you do not want to use a command line interface, 
you can use [Platypus](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus). This repo contains a 
Platypus profile with which you can wrap the script. Documentation to do this is on the Platypus repo.
